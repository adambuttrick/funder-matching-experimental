## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook is designed for training a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model using the Flair framework, specifically focusing on identifying funder and award entities in funding statements.

## Requirements
- Flair NLP library
- PyTorch

## Usage
1. Install required libraries.
2. Load and preprocess the dataset.
3. Define the NER model using Flair.
4. Train the model on the preprocessed data.
5. Evaluate the model's performance.

## Data
Data format and source should be compatible with Flair's data handling. See [flair-ner-funding-statements-10K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/adambuttrick/flair-ner-funding-statements-10K) for an example.
